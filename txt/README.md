# TXT ingestion

These directories do not contain the TXT files used to generate the RSS feeds.

To generate Kosa's feeds (similar to RSS feeds), you will need to populate these
directories with the appropriate TXT files for each language. Ask Brihas for
these TXT files. They are not publicly available and should not be checked into
source control.

## Directories:

```
/txt/pali
/txt/buddha
/txt/dohas
```
