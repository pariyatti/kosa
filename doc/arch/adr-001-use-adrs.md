# Architecture Decision Record: Use ADRs

## Context

The Pariyatti mobile app and `kosa` (the service which supports it) will be long-lived softare maintained by a wide range of volunteers over the coming years. It is important for us to document our intentions clearly so future volunteers find the codebase easy to understand.

## Decision

We will use [Architecture Decision Records](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

All major architecture decisions require a "proposed" or "accepted" ADR --- or both.
