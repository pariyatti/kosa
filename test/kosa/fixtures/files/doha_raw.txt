Dharama Dharama to saba kaheṅ, 
para samajhe nā koya. 
Śuddha citta kā ācaraṇa, 
śuddha Dharama hai soya. 

Dharama Dharama to saba kaheṅ, 
Dharama nā samajhe koya. 
Nirmala mana kā ācaraṇa, 
Satya Dharama hai soya.

Everyone talks about Dhamma 
but no one understands it. 
Practicing purity of mind— 
this is true Dhamma.

Sukha chāe saṅsāra meṅ, 
dukhiyā rahe na koya. 
Jana jana mana jāge Dharama, 
jana jana sukhiyā hoya.

May happiness spread through the universe, 
may no one remain wretched, 
may the Dhamma arise in the minds of all, 
may everyone be contented.
